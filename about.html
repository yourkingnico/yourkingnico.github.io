Welcome to my site! My name is Nick, and I'm a Junior at Ball State University. Programming is more than 
just a hobby of mine, and I put together this site to demonstrate just that. I am currently working with
the Ball State University Digital Corps, and I am learning fast! My role at the Corps has me working with both front end
and back end development. Some technologies I am actively exploring are: PHP, SQL, Angular JS, Android, and iOS.
Please be sure to check out my <a href="resume.html"> resume</a> and take a look around.
Special thanks to everyone on Github who contributed to the<a href="https://github.com/PanosSakkos/personal-jekyll-theme"> personal</a> theme!
