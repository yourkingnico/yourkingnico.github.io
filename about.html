## About
<small>
Welcome to my site! My name is Nick, and I'm a Junior at Ball State University. Programming is more than just a hobby of mine, and I built this site to demonstrate just that! Please be sure to check out my <a href="resume.html"> resume</a> and take a look around.
Special thanks to everyone on Github who contributed to the<a href="https://github.com/PanosSakkos/personal-jekyll-theme"> personal</a> theme!
