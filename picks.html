				This photo maniputaion was created for a previous CS class using Jython. The top left image is
				repeated with multiple effects, which are placed together on a canvas. While this project is by no 
				means my best or current work, it served as a fun exercise to develop my skills in a language that 
				was previously new to me. You can check out the code <a href="portfolio/project1Code.txt" >here.</a>

			<h2 class="subTitle"> Base Conversion Learning Tool </h2>
			<img  id="basePic" src="img/baseScreenshot.png" />
			<p>
					The Base Conversion Tool seen above was developed over a nine week period in my Advanced Programming
				class. I originally pitched this idea to my group as an overall learning tool that would allow the
				user to learn the main base conversions, practice at varying difficulties in a quiz mode, and
				yield a quick and agile base calculator. I was extremely satisfied that we accomplished these goals,
				although it was not easy. Some of my contributions to this project include: implementing the Observer Design Pattern,
				managing project dependencies with <a href="https://maven.apache.org/" >Apache Maven</a>, developing both the
				quiz mode and calculator in javaFX, and building the executable JAR. This group project both challenged me
				and aided in further developing my Java skills in a collaborative environment. Please be sure to checkout some 
				of my code snippets and contributions<a href="project2Code.html" > here.</a>

				But don't just take my word for it! <a href="portfolio/baseConversionTool.jar"

				target="_blank">Java Runtime Environment</a>).

			<h2 class="subTitle"> Nick's WebGl Travel Globe </h2>

			<p>
				This past Summer I spent a lot of time exploring and learning some basic techniques in web development.
				While this mainly included HTML and CSS, I have since moved on toward learning javascript. This open 
				source <a href="https://github.com/dataarts/webgl-globe" >Chrome Experiment </a> was a perfect project
				to help me understand the basics of the language, and how javascript can work together with other languages
				on a webpage. Currently I am not yest satisfied with the total functionality of the globe, and I hope to see
				some improvements as I continue to develop it. In the mean time, check out my first 
				<a href="portfolio/indexG.html" >release. </a>
