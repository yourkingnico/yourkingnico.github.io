				This photo maniputaion was created for a previous CS class using Jython. The top left image is
				repeated with multiple effects, which are placed together on a canvas. While this project is by no 
				means my best or current work, it served as a fun exercise to develop my skills in a language that 
				was previously new to me. You can check out the code <a href="project1Code.txt" >here.</a>
